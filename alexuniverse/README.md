Alex Universe

This is a simulation of self evolving and populating ML models.

The environment, or Alex Universe, in which the ML models are simulated consists of:
* A 2-D space
* A 1-D Timeline
* A finite collection of Matter that is consumable by/valueable to ML models
* A collection ML models that needs to accurately predict where to go to find enough matter, last enough time at a stable physical space, to self-replicate with probability of parameter changing. ML models have limited life span.

The goal of the simulation is to observe interesting behaviors of self evolving ML models, and investigate how different initial conditions lead to different or similar results.
